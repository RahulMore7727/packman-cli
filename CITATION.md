# Citing DepMan

If you use DepMan in your research or projects, we would appreciate it if you cite it appropriately. Citing helps acknowledge the effort put into developing DepMan and makes it easier for others to find and use it.

## BibTeX

```bibtex
@software{DepMan,
  author = {Dylan Archer},
  title = {{DepMan: A Modern Dependency Manager}},
  url = {https://github.com/dylarcher/depman},
  version = {0.1.0}, % Replace with the version you used if known, otherwise omit or use the latest
  date = {2023-10-27}, % Replace with the last updated date from the repository if known, otherwise omit
}
```

Replace `version` and `date` with the specific version and date you used if possible, otherwise, you can use the information available on the GitHub repository page.

Thank you for using DepMan!
